# Credit-Score-Prediction-For-Loaners
This repository contains the code and resources for my Credit Score Prediction project. In this project, I aim to predict the likelihood of a credit applicant defaulting on their loan based on various features and data points. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Highlights:
Conducted data preprocessing and handled missing values.
Explored the dataset using visualizations and insights.
Engineered new features to enhance the predictive power of the model.
Utilized machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for classification.
Addressed class imbalance using techniques such as SMOTE.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score.
Provided in-depth insights into the project through visualizations and explanations.

## Folder Structure:
Datasets: Contains the dataset used for the project and also the predictions on the test dataset.
Credit Score Prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook detailing data preprocessing, analysis & visualizations, feature engineering, and modeling steps.
README.md: Detailed project overview.


Feel free to explore the notebooks to understand the step-by-step process I followed to build and evaluate the predictive model. Your feedback and suggestions are welcome!
