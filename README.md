# Credit-Score-Prediction-For-Loaners
This repository contains the code and resources for my Credit Score Prediction project. In this project, I aim to predict the likelihood of a credit applicant defaulting on their loan based on various features and data points. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
